for this stage of the product I helped with setting up the Main class by adding the skeleton for how the Main menu and sub menus can work. 
(Hunter helped clean it up later to make it look more clean). I then worked on trying to find the right data structure for the data bases
originaly thought about using arrays then swithed it to array list. (it was a little to late to use maps). I did some work on the Data base
actions class, I worked on the method that initiates the data base, the methods that work on the customers lists, organized the tostring methods
helped with the comments, created the user guide pdf, and a couple other little things.
